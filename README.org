* Install
+ Copy this folder into =/usr/share/plymouth/themes/=.

#+begin_src shell

sudo plymouth-set-default-theme arch-reaper

# If you use dracut and systemd-boot
sudo dracut --regenerate-all --force

#+end_src

+ I use =systemd-boot= and =dracut=. You may be using =GRUB= and =mkinitcpio=.
+ Check the Arch wiki for more information reagrding that.

* Disclaimer & License
+ I customized =arch-beat= plymouth theme to make this theme.
+ I am not sure about the licensing of that theme.
+ So arch-reaper theme will (for now, at least) be seen as a derivative of arch-beat theme.
